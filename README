BTSync Rewind will, on the fly, generate past snapshots of a
Bittorrent Sync repository. It is implemented as a FUSE file system.

To run from source, remember to update the fusepy library after cloning:

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

To run:

$ mkdir /dev/shm/rewind-view
$ python btsync_rewind.py /media/disk/btsync/repo /dev/shm/rewind-view

To see current state of repo:

$ ls /dev/shm/review-view/$(date +%s)

To the state at the same time yesterday:

$ ls /dev/shm/review-view/$(date --date='yesterday' +%s)

To view what a file a week ago yesterday:

$ less /dev/shm/review-view/$(date --date='1 week ago' +%s)/file.txt

You get the idea.

When you're done:

$ fusermount -u /dev/shm/rewind-view
